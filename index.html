                The User land to My website and then there will be a User Authentication that I created on Glitch by using Skeleton Website.
                Like this:
            </p>
            <div class="login_main">
                <div class="login_main1">

                </div>
            </div>
            <p>After Login , then the user will access to our website content. The user will then be able to Search for a Book by Author Name or Book name or either One of these. Then the user will find the book he or she was looking for easily through this Search Bar :</p>
            <div class="search_main">
                <div class="search_main1">
                    <img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/062d57a6-6773-4a4c-ac46-5f3da84e4787%2Fsearch.PNG?v=1614109241505" alt="">
                </div>
                <div class="search_main2">
                    <img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/062d57a6-6773-4a4c-ac46-5f3da84e4787%2Fsearchlayout.PNG?v=1614109241553" alt="">
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>For the database management, I used FireBase Database and the books are added by using the Queries in the form of Arrays or Objects. Like This:</p>
            <div class="db_main">
                <div class="db_main1">
                    <img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/062d57a6-6773-4a4c-ac46-5f3da84e4787%2Fdbbook.PNG?v=1614109240896" alt="">
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>After Adding the Books in the Database, the user will be able to find the book he or she wants. Regarding Firebase I managed it by using: <b>view_item_list</b> Like This:</p>
            <div class="slect_main">
                <div class="slect_main1">
                    <img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/062d57a6-6773-4a4c-ac46-5f3da84e4787%2Fslectbook.PNG?v=1614109242123" alt="">
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>After Selecting the Book, the next process is Checkout Process. By using Firebase, I can add or remove the books in the database by logging an <b>add_to_wishlist</b> or <b>add_to_cart event</b>, respectively, with the relevant products in an items array parameter.</p>
            <div class="slect_main">
                <div class="slect_main1">
                    <img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/062d57a6-6773-4a4c-ac46-5f3da84e4787%2Fcheckout.PNG?v=1614109241207" alt="">
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>After Checkout initiation, then the next step is Payment Integration. I managed the Payment in FireBase as Log <b>add_payment_info</b> when a user submits their payment information. If applicable, include <b>payment_type</b> with this event for the chosen method of payment.</p>
            <div class="slect_main">
                <div class="slect_main1">
                    <img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/062d57a6-6773-4a4c-ac46-5f3da84e4787%2Fpayment.PNG?v=1614109241652" alt="">
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>By this We can create a FireBase Database for <b><q>The Book Basement</q></b> and have great Online Book Shopping experience.</p>
